## CHEESYchords is a music gizmo plays chords mostly. 
### It's designed so that you can basically mash things randomly with no idea what you're doing and still sound okay. 

It can be used to generate inspiration, as part of your musical ensemble, or as an instrument you give to your little brother who doesn't really know what's going on but wants to play with your band.
## INSTRUCTIONS

In CHORD mode (switch with the L button when not in menu), you can vibe out by playing chords. Use the D-pad, A/B, and Select buttons to play chords in the selected key. Holding down the R button will make a 7th chord if you're feeling fancy.

In SEQ mode, you can freestyle single notes within a key, but you can also use the SEQUENCEr. Enter menu mode (press start), set your sequence by filling each slot with A/B and R. L button will remove. Leave menu mode by pressing start again and you'll hear the sequence!

Try experimenting with arpeggio and BPM, and mix in 7ths willy nilly; you'll basically get a melody generator!
